%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m

% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.

% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.

%--------------------Part 1--------------------
% Add column of 1's to the matrix X
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% Create a 10x10 (number of labels) identity matrix.
% Each target value in vector y selects the row index of the identity matrix.
% This recodes the labels as vector containing only values 0 or 1.
y_matrix = eye(num_labels)(y, :);

% Create matrix a3 with neural network outputs
z2 = X * Theta1';
a2 = [ones(m, 1) sigmoid(z2)];
a3 = sigmoid(a2 * Theta2');

% Calculate cost with given parameters 'Theta1' and 'Theta2'
err_matrix = -y_matrix .* log(a3) - (1 .- y_matrix) .* log(1 .- a3);
cost = sum(err_matrix) * ones(size(y_matrix, 2), 1) / m;

% Remove the bias paramaters
theta1_nb = Theta1(:,2:end);
theta2_nb = Theta2(:,2:end);

% Calculate regularization
theta1_reg = sum(theta1_nb .^ 2) * ones(size(theta1_nb, 2), 1);
theta2_reg = sum(theta2_nb .^ 2) * ones(size(theta2_nb, 2), 1);
J = cost + (theta1_reg + theta2_reg) * lambda / (2 * m);

%--------------------Part 2--------------------
% Set error for d3
d3 = a3 - y_matrix;

% Set error for the hidden layer (l = 2)
d2 = d3 * Theta2(:,2:end) .* sigmoidGradient(z2);

% Accumelate and obtain the gradient
Theta1_grad = d2' * X / m;
Theta2_grad = d3' * a2 / m;

%--------------------Part 3-------------------
% Replace first column of the Theta1 and Theta2 matrices with 0's 
Theta1(:,1) = 0;
Theta2(:,1) = 0;

% Add regularization to the Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad matrices
Theta1_grad += Theta1 * (lambda / m);
Theta2_grad += Theta2 * (lambda / m);

% Unroll gradients
